# Python Data Structures

This repository contains data structures and algorithms questions in Python. 

## :dart: Objective

The open source community has helped me a lot during my interview preparations and studies while I was in my undergrad. I always wanted to give something back to the community. In my endeavour to contribute something back, I will be uploading data structures and algorithms questions in Python in this repo. Feel free to contribute and get in touch! :smiley:

## :file_folder: Structure of the repository

As of now, the repository contains a file called `useful_links.txt` and 2 main directories: **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**.

### Data Structures

Contains all data structure questions categorised into sub-directories like stack, queue, etc according to their type.

    1. Array 
    2. Dictionary
    3. Binary Search Tree  
    4. Linked List  
    5. Stack  
    6. Graphs  
    7. Circular Linked List
    8.Avl Tree 
### Algorithms

Contains algorithm-based questions like dynamic programming, greedy etc.

## :clipboard: Things need to be done

As you can see, the repo is still in its infancy. Here are some key things in the to-do.

    1. Queue questions
    2. Algorithms  
        2.1. Dynamic Programming  
        2.2. Greedy   
    3. More questions in data structures, especially for graph, circular linked list, tries, heaps and hash.
